# Physiotherapy Note Template

Extract information only from provided transcripts/notes. Document objectively and quote patient verbatim where applicable.

## 1. Subjective Assessment

### A. Chief Complaint

**Primary Concerns:**
- Document exact patient description (e.g., "sharp pain in right knee when climbing stairs")
- Onset timing and mechanism (e.g., "started 3 days ago after tennis match")
- Pain characteristics if reported:
  - Intensity (e.g., "7/10 at worst, 3/10 at rest")
  - Quality (e.g., "burning", "throbbing")
  - Location/radiation (use anatomical terms)

### B. History of Present Condition

**Progression:**
- Timeline of symptoms
- Pattern (e.g., "worse in morning, improves with movement")
- Previous episodes if relevant

**Modifying Factors:**
- Aggravating activities/positions (e.g., "increases with prolonged sitting")
- Relieving factors (e.g., "ice provides temporary relief")
- 24-hour pattern (e.g., "disrupts sleep when lying on affected side")

**Prior Interventions:**
- Previous physiotherapy/treatments
- Self-management strategies tried
- Medication use for condition

### C. Functional Impact Assessment

**Activities of Daily Living:**
- Specific limitations (e.g., "unable to lift grocery bags")
- Modified activities (e.g., "using elevator instead of stairs")
- Independence level

**Work/Sport/Leisure:**
- Job demands/modifications
- Sport participation restrictions
- Impact on hobbies/recreation

## 2. Objective Assessment

### A. Observation

**General:**
- Posture analysis (specific deviations)
- Weight-bearing status
- Visible asymmetries
- Assistive device use

**Local:**
- Swelling (measure/location)
- Skin changes/color
- Muscle wasting
- Deformity

**Gait Analysis:**
- Temporal/spatial parameters
- Specific deviations
- Weight-bearing phases

### B. Physical Examination

**ROM Measurements:**
- Active/Passive ROM (document in degrees)
- End-feel characteristics
- Movement quality

**Strength Testing:**
- MMT grades by muscle group
- Functional strength tests
- Side-to-side comparison

**Special Tests:**
- List specific tests performed
- Document positive/negative findings
- Note test reliability if relevant

**Palpation:**
- Tissue temperature/texture
- Tender points (document location)
- Muscle tone/spasm

**Joint Assessment:**
- Accessory movements
- Joint play
- Capsular pattern

**Neurological Screen (if indicated):**
- Myotomes/dermatomes
- Reflexes
- Neural tension tests

## 3. Clinical Reasoning

**Assessment:**
- Primary diagnosis/hypothesis
- Contributing factors (biomechanical/psychosocial)
- Stage/irritability level
- Precautions/contraindications

**Outcome Measures:**
- Standardized tests used
- Baseline scores
- Functional benchmarks

## 4. Management Plan

### A. Treatment Provided

**Manual Therapy:**
- Specific techniques/grades
- Areas treated
- Patient response

**Exercise Prescription:**
- Detailed parameters (sets/reps/intensity)
- Movement corrections
- Progression criteria

**Modalities:**
- Type/parameters
- Duration/frequency
- Treatment goals

**Education:**
- Activity modifications
- Posture/ergonomic advice
- Pain management strategies

### B. Home Program

**Exercises:**
- Written/illustrated instructions
- Clear parameters
- Monitoring method

**Self-Management:**
- Activity pacing
- Heat/ice protocol
- Red flags to monitor

### C. Follow-up Plan

**Schedule:**
- Next appointment
- Treatment frequency
- Duration estimate

**Goals:**
- Short-term objectives
- Long-term outcomes
- Return to activity targets

**Progress Measures:**
- Key indicators to monitor
- Expected timeline
- Discharge criteria
